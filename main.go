// Package classification RumAir..
//
// Hi !
//
// Please take a look at this app as a Hackerrank task done little bit wider.
//
// It is contenerized application, consist of two containers, public swaggerUI (pulled from DockerHub) and custom AbaxTestApi one.
// Both are deployed on Azure Docker Instances service.
//
// My container (AbaxTestApi) is build via Dockerfile and then its pushed to my private Azure Docker Container by Azure DevOps pipeline YML (./'az-pipelines.docker.yml )
// During this Docker build, there is a 'swagger.json' artifact produced also, validated and stored to be static hosted at /swagger/swagger.json endpoint.
//
// The app is in Golang, which I am into intesively last times, but it doesnt matter. I just wanted to practice it, I could do it in C# also.
//
// Still almost non of Unit tests, some parts are fixed instead to be injected during deploy, and it wasnt done in 1 hour :-) but ...
// at least I learnt a lot, and I hope you like it.
